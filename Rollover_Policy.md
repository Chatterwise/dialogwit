# Token Rollover Policy

We want to ensure you get the most value from your subscription. That’s why unused tokens from your previous billing period roll over to the next period, and you keep all your earned tokens, even if you change your plan.

## How Token Rollover Works

### 1. **Rollover Calculation**

At the end of each billing period, we calculate how many tokens you haven’t used. If you change your plan (upgrade or downgrade), you’ll always keep your unused tokens plus any tokens you’ve rolled over from previous periods.

**Here’s how we calculate your new token balance:**

- **Used Tokens:** The number of tokens you’ve used in the last billing period.
- **Previous Rollover:** Any tokens you’ve already rolled over from previous periods.
- **Rollover Limit:** Your previous plan’s monthly token limit.
- **New Plan Tokens:** The number of tokens included in your new plan.

**Computed Rollover:**  
`max(0, Rollover Limit - Used Tokens) + Previous Rollover`

### 2. **New Token Balance**

When your plan renews, upgrades, or you pay to downgrade, your new token balance is:

**New Total Tokens = New Plan Tokens + Computed Rollover**

---

## Example

- **Used Tokens:** 5,000
- **Previous Rollover:** 25,000
- **Rollover Limit:** 100,000
- **New Plan Tokens:** 100,000

**Computed Rollover:**  
`max(0, 100,000 - 5,000) + 25,000 = 95,000 + 25,000 = 120,000`

**New Token Balance:**  
`100,000 (new plan) + 120,000 (rollover) = 220,000 total tokens`

---

## Key Points

- **You always keep your unused tokens, even if you change your plan.**
- **There is no penalty for changing plans—you’ll always receive your new plan’s tokens plus all rolled-over tokens.**
- **You must pay to downgrade your plan, so downgrades are treated the same as upgrades or renewals for token allocation.**
